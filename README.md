### What I learned

This was my first project fully utilizing the json data provided by Frontend Mentor. I honestly didn't even notice that there were different displays for daily, weekly, and monthly selections, I just figured it was there for the hover state as shown in the active-states picture provided. After reading the README I saw that it was supposed to swap the data in and out, and decided to try and learn how to use json files. I think it turned out pretty well! Very happy with the result.
